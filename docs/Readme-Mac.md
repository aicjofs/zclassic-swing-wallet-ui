# [ZCash](https://z.cash/) Desktop GUI Wallet - for Mac OS (UNFINISHED!)

ZCash for Mac OS is not yet officially supported. Thanks to [@radix42](https://github.com/radix42) an experimental build has been provided.
Before installing the GUI wallet on Mac OS you need to [install ZCash on Mac OS](https://github.com/radix42/zcash/blob/v1.0.1-gcc-mac/README-mac.md).
Please follow the link for this. In case of any problems you may contact the developer for help ;-)
For the rest of this document we assume that you have a ZCash node (zcashd) running on Mac OS...

1. Build tools

   You need to install git, JDK 8 and Ant for Mac OS to build the GUI wallet. The commands 
   `git`, `java`, `javac` and `ant` need to be startable from command line before proceeding with 
   build. The procedure could be:

   1.1. [Install homebrew](http://brew.sh/)

   1.2. Install git: `brew install git`

   1.3. [Install JDK 8](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/mac_jdk.html)

   1.4. [Install Ant](http://www.admfactory.com/how-to-install-apache-ant-on-mac-os-x/)

2. Building the ZCash GUI wallet

   Version 0.37 (beta) or later needs to be built from source. The build procedure is the same as on Linux. 
   Summary of commands:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/vaklinov/zcash-swing-wallet-ui.git
   cd zcash-swing-wallet-ui/
   ant -buildfile ./src/build/build.xml
   chmod u+x ./build/jars/ZCashSwingWalletUI.jar
   ```
   At this point the build process is finished the built GUI wallet program is the JAR 
   file `./build/jars/ZCashSwingWalletUI.jar`

3. Installing the built ZCash GUI wallet

   Assuming you have already built from source code [ZCash](https://z.cash/) in directory `/Users/joe/zcash/src` (for 
   example) you need to take the created file `./build/jars/ZCashSwingWalletUI.jar` and copy it 
   to directory `/Users/joe/zcash/src` (the same dir. that contains `zcash-cli` and `zcashd`). Example copy command:
   ```
   cp ./build/jars/ZCashSwingWalletUI.jar /Users/joe/zcash/src    
   ```

4. Running the installed ZCash GUI wallet

   Before running the GUI you need to start zcashd (e.g. `zcashd --daemon`). The wallet GUI is a Java program packaged 
   as an executable JAR file. It may be run from command line or started from another GUI tool (e.g. file manager). 
   Assuming you have already installed [ZCash](https://z.cash/) and the GUI Wallet `ZCashSwingWalletUI.jar` in 
   directory `/Users/joe/zcash/src` one way to run it from command line is:
   ```
   java -jar /Users/joe/zcash/src/ZCashSwingWalletUI.jar
   ```
   You may instead just use Mac the file manager and double-click on the `ZCashSwingWalletUI.jar`. 
   This will start the ZCash GUI wallet.

### Known issues and limitations

1. Limitation: Wallet encryption has been temporarily disabled in ZCash due to stability problems. A corresponding issue 
[#1552](https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/1552) has been opened by the ZCash developers. Correspondingly
wallet encryption has been temporarily disabled in the ZCash Desktop GUI Wallet.
1. Issue: the GUI wallet does not work correctly if zcashd is started with a custom data directory, like:
`zcashd -datadir=/home/data/whatever` This will be fixed in later versions.
1. Issue: GUI data tables (transactions/addresses etc.) allow copying of data via double click but also allow editing. 
The latter needs to be disabled. 
1. Limitation: The list of transactions does not show all outgoing ones (specifically outgoing Z address 
transactions). A corresponding issue [#1438](https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/1438) has been opened 
for the ZCash developers - soon to be fixed. A fix for the GUI wallet may be expected within 1-2 weeks. 
1. Limitation: The CPU percentage shown to be taken by zcashd is the average for the entire lifetime of the process. 
This is not very useful. This will be improved in future versions.
